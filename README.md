## 1. Project Description

Hello, the name of my project is Design of Medical Procedures and Wayfinding Experience.
This project was inspired by some feelings I had when I accompanied my brother to the hospital.

### 1.1 Field Research

First, I did a preliminary analysis based on field research.

There are three important stakeholders in the hospital: parents, children and doctors; the behavior of all three affects and restricts each other.

Firstly, parents are often anxious about the process and the long waiting time, and are easily lost because they are not familiar with the hospital environment.

Doctors are also prone to emotional problems during the process because of the excessive workload and the lack of cooperation from the children because they are too young.

For the children, there are not many things that can attract their attention during the waiting process, which makes them feel that the waiting time is very long and their original fear of seeking medical treatment tends to become deeper and deeper.

### 1.2 Conclusion

In general, parents are easily tired of the repeated queue, payment and waiting process; children tend to deepen their fear of hospitals through waiting, so we need to solve this problem

For children, the most interesting thing is the cartoon characters, in order to help them eliminate the fear of hospitals, I use the cartoon IP image involved in my design.

My design strategy is to create an app that allows children and parents to enjoy a better medical experience during their visit.

In addition to the basic functions, I added an AR smart navigation and games function to the app and combined it with the redesigned wayfinding signs in the hospital.

## 2. App Design

### 1.1 Interface Design

It has five design goals, convenience, company, education, feedback and data, targeting parents, children and hospitals.

The visual aspect caters to the visual preference of children, mainly using sans serif fonts and brighter colors, the whole page is lively and lovely. IP characters are mainly flat, and they appear in various interfaces of the app, so that users can slowly get familiar with them.

According to the research, I divided the general product structure into four main parts, self-service, pharmacy, navigation and personal center.

According to the combing, I drew out a rough wireframe diagram and logical contact page.

In the process of using the app, usera often encounter some glitches, then there will also be some cute icons added to increase the interest of the page.

### 1.2 AR Design

AR music (touch screen, clicking objects on screen)

When the recognition map is scanned, a virtual button will appear next to each character. Touching these buttons on the phone can trigger different notesðŸŽµ to play the song.

Here's the [code](https://github.com/YuchenTan777/CCI-S3-ENVIRONMENT-FINAL/tree/main/AR%20music/code)

2. AR quiz (virtual button)

When scanning the recognition map, three AR virtual buttons will appear to simulate different test answers, and choosing different answers will trigger different scene models.

Here's the [code](https://github.com/YuchenTan777/CCI-S3-ENVIRONMENT-FINAL/tree/main/AR%20quiz/code)

## 3. Signage Design

Then came the design of signage.

After research, I identified the key points in the hospital building that now need wayfinding and guide signs.

The signage is dominated by brighter colors, with IP characters as the main visual element. Mainly divided into outdoor guide signs, section guide signs

It helps to locate the building and section you need to go to as soon as possible. The materials are all made of PVC materials that are easy to color and shape.

When the app opens the navigation, the AR cartoon character will appear after scanning to the outdoor signage, guiding the fastest walking route. When you reach the building, select the department to continue navigation. You can scan the environmental graphics for a science quiz when waiting for a consultation. It increases the accuracy and fun of the user when using for wayfinding.

## 4. Journey Map

Finally, there is a user experience map with the addition of app and sign boards. The childrenâ€™s fear is reduced by using diversion or concentration at different times of the day. The combination of online and offline facilitates the process for parents, and the hospital provides better service for parents by better managing child data through the backend.
